DHT22 sensor consists of two components for measuring; Humidity sensing component and the NTC temperature sensor (or a thermistor). There is an IC on 
the back side which makes the readings to be able to read by the Raspberry pi.

While measuring the humidity, the humidity sensor comes into play. The humidity sensor consists of two electrodes with moisture holding substrate between
 them. So when the humidity changes, the conductivity of substrate changes or you can say that the resistance between the electrodes changes. This change 
in resistance is then given to IC which makes it to read by the Raspberry pi.

While measuring the temperature, the NTC temperature sensor or thermistor comes into play. The resistance of the thermistor changes with change in the 
temperature. These are negative temperature coefficient (NTC) which means that their resistance decreases with the increase in temperature.
