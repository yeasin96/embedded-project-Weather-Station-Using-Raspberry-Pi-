The air quality sensor has a small potentiometer that permits the adjustment of the load resistance of the sensor circuit. The 5V power supply is used for air
quality quality sensor.

The air quality sensor is a signal output indicator instruction. It has two outputs: analog output and TTL output. The TTL output is low signal
 light which can be accessed through the IO ports on the Microcontroller. The analog output is an concentration, i.e. increasing voltage is directly 
proportional to increasing concentration. This sensor has a long life and reliable stability as well.
